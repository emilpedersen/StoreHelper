/// Support for StoreKit1. Tells the observer that a user initiated an in-app purchase direct from the App Store,
/// rather than via the app itself. StoreKit2 does not (yet) provide support for this feature so we need to use
/// StoreKit1. This is a requirement in order to promote in-app purchases on the App Store. If your app doesn't
/// have a class that implements `SKPaymentTransactionObserver` and the `paymentQueue(_:updatedTransactions:)`
/// and `paymentQueue(_:shouldAddStorePayment:for:)` delegate methods then you'll get an error when you submit
/// the app to the App Store and you have IAP promotions.
///
/// Note that any IAPs made from **inside** the app are processed by StoreKit2 and do not involve this helper class.
