/// Helper class for subscriptions.
///
/// The methods in this class require that auto-renewing subscription product ids adopt the naming
/// convention: "com.{author}.subscription.{subscription-group-name}.{product-name}".
/// For example, "com.rarcher.subscription.vip.bronze".
///
/// Also, service level relies on the ordering of product ids within a subscription group in the
/// Products.plist file. A product appearing higher (towards the top of the group) will have a higher
/// service level than one appearing lower down. If a group has three subscription products then the
/// highest service level product will have a service level of 2, while the third product will have
/// a service level of 0.
